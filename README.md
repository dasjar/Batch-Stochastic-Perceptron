# Batch-Stochastic-Perceptron
This repository contains code to implement batch and stochastic perceptron. It also shows the effect of choosing a bias and a learning rate parameter. The experiment shows that it is best to use a fixed learning rate instead of a dynamic one if you are not sure of the selection.
